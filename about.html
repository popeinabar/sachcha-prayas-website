                    Our Story
                </h1>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base mb-6  lg:px-12">
                    The roots of Sachcha Prayas Sanstha's dates back to the concept of providing tailoring training in
                    Gram Panchayat Harduli Bargi Nagar during 2007-2008. It was officially registered under the Society
                    Act in November, 2009. Despite limited financial resources and infrastructure, the organisation's
                    unwavering commitment drove its initial efforts.

                    The organisation's mission addresses the need to empower women in rural areas, enabling them to earn
                    a livelihood while staying in their communities. It aims to enhance economic autonomy and
                    recognition for women who often shoulder household and agricultural responsibilities.


                    Despite starting with minimal planning, the organisation's credibility, founder's reputation and
                    community support contributed to its early success.

                    Milestones for the organisation included gaining support from Women and Child Development
                    Department, YMCA Sanstha Jabalpur, and other organisations. Successful transformations of women's
                    lives through skill acquisition and empowerment marked significant achievements.

                    Currently, Sachcha Prayas Sanstha continues to focus on women's empowerment and child rights
                    advocacy. It collaborates with various organisations like Madhya Pradesh Sustainable Development and
                    numerous government and non-government entities.

                    The projected goal for the organisation is to make 200 women self-reliant through
                    employment-oriented initiatives and create a positive atmosphere for child rights advocacy in at
                    least 10 Gram Panchayats.

                    The organisation faces challenges, including lack of technical staff, resources, and regular
                    funding. Efforts are underway to address these issues and improve documentation.

                    Enhanced accessibility would greatly benefit the marginalised communities, especially displaced
                    families, tribal, SC, ST, and backward-class individuals, targeted by Sachcha Prayas Sanstha's
                    initiatives.

                    Sachcha Prayas Sanstha's journey traces back to the idea of providing tailoring training in Gram
                    Panchayat Harduli Bargi Nagar during 2007-2008. Officially registered under the Society Act on
                    November 17, 2009, our organisation embarked on its mission with a steadfast commitment despite
                    initial resource limitations.

                    Founded by Mr. Mohd Parvez Khan, Sachcha Prayas Sanstha is rooted in his personal experiences as
                    part of a displaced family. Motivated by his journalistic endeavours, Parvez established the
                    organisation to uplift rural women and address their unique challenges.

                    Our mission centres around empowering women in rural areas, equipping them with skills to earn a
                    livelihood within their communities. By enhancing economic autonomy and recognition, we aim to
                    alleviate the burden often borne by women in household and agricultural responsibilities.

                    training. Soon,we realised that this scheme garnered limited interest because the prevailing
                    mindset among people was that free things lack quality and value. So, we introduced a nominal
                    fee that led to increased participation and momentum in our project. We started with 10 women,

                    Mr. Parvez Khan was born into a traditional landlord family in the village of Mankedi in Jabalpur,
                    Madhya Pradesh. However, his family faced displacement due to the construction of the Bargi Dam when
                    he was born in 1981. This shifted them from landlords to displaced individuals. Parvez grew up
                    witnessing the struggles of his own family and the surrounding displaced community, which fueled his
                    determination to make a difference.

                </p>

                <p>
                    After completing his education, including a degree in journalism and mass communication, Parvez
                    chose rural journalism as his path. He used media as a platform to shed light on issues related to
                    water, forests, land, and displacement in rural areas. He also pursued a master's degree in rural
                    development and decided to forgo traditional employment opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Driven by a desire to empower women in his community, Parvez noticed that local women were engaged
                    in labor-intensive tasks like collecting wood, tending to cattle, and agricultural work. He
                    envisioned a way to help them gain skills that would enable them to lead financially independent
                    lives with dignity. Collaborating with Neha Sharma, a friend working on dress designing and women's
                    issues, Parvez initiated a training center for women, offering courses in sewing, embroidery, and
                    beauty skills. Despite resource constraints, he started the first training center in an Anganwadi
                    (childcare center), providing free training to 15 women.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This initiative gained recognition from the Women and Child Development Department and marked the
                    successful launch of Sacha Prayas, an organization aimed at uplifting rural women through skill
                    development and empowerment. Despite limited resources, Parvez's determination and vision led to the
                    creation of a meaningful organization that aimed to transform the lives of women in his community.
